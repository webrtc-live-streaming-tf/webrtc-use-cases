    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The current livestreaming multimedia ecosystem is showing diverse and robust growth trends. It covers
      livestreaming content from both institutions and individuals in various fields to meet the diverse needs of users.
      In this ecosystem, major tech companies are strategically involved in different areas to provide richer,
      practical, and entertaining livestreaming experiences.

    </p>

    <p>

      Alibaba Group demonstrates strong capabilities in the livestreaming sector. Its livestreaming e-commerce combines
      shopping and entertainment, offering consumers immersive shopping experiences. Through methods like hosts
      showcasing products and interactive Q&A sessions, consumers are engaged in making purchases. Additionally, Alibaba
      also offers fundamental livestreaming cloud services, spanning education and gaming sectors, providing technical
      support for creating livestreaming platforms for businesses and individuals.

    </p>

    <p>

      Chia Mobile MiGu, an integrated media platform, focuses on providing diverse livestreaming content. Particularly
      in
      large-scale event livestreaming, MiGu offers real-time broadcasts of significant events like sports competitions
      and music concerts, meeting users' demand for immediate experiences. Moreover, MiGu experiments with
      virtual-physical interactions using technologies like digital avatars, creating a more enriched virtual
      interactive experience for users.


    </p>

    <p>
      ByteDance plays a crucial role in interactive entertainment, online education, and conferencing. Its TikTok
      platform has become a globally popular short video platform, providing users with abundant entertainment content,
      including livestreaming. ByteDance has also ventured into livestreamed educational content to accommodate learners
      seeking flexible learning approaches. In the business sector, its livestreamed conferencing solutions offer
      efficient remote communication and collaboration platforms for enterprises.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      This document uses the following terms with the specific meanings defined here. Where possible these meanings are
      consistent with common usage. However, note that common usage of some of these terms have multiple, ambiguous, or
      inconsistent meanings. The definition here will take precedence. When terms are used with the specific meanings
      defined here they will be capitalized. When possible reference to existing standards defining these terms is
      given.

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">Audio Vivid</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The first AI-based audio encoding and decoding standard, released by the UHD World Association (UWA). Within
        the Audio Vivid three-dimensional space, sound objects can be precisely positioned and moved freely, while also
        presenting richer sound details, constructing expansive or subtle three-dimensional soundscapes.</dd>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <section>
      <h2 id="uc-cb">5G Cloud Box (UC-CB)</h2>

      <p>
        A "Cloud Box" can be understood as a cloud-based private room, similar to the private room we have in our real
        lives. Friends can come together in these rooms to chat, watch movies, and watching sports events. In sports
        broadcasts, fans can participate in predictions and discussions about ongoing matches through the "5G Cloud Box"
        feature, enabling them to share their insights and forecasts in real-time. The Cloud Box feature bridges the gap
        between individuals, enhancing their immersive experience and interaction.
      </p>

      <p>In order to provide a more immersive user experience, spatial audio is utilized in WebRTC.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="UC-RLC">Real-time Live Commerce (UC-RLC)</h2>
      <p>

        Real-time Live Commerce, also known as real-time livestream shopping, is an innovative retail trend that merges
        real-time streaming
        with e-commerce. In Live Commerce sessions, businesses and brands showcase their products or services on live
        online platforms, such as social media and e-commerce websites, while simultaneously engaging with the audience
        in direct interactions. During these live sessions, hosts or salespeople introduce product features, demonstrate
        usage, address viewer inquiries, and offer exclusive deals or limited-time promotions.

      </p>

      <p>

        Viewers can actively participate by using real-time commenting or chat features to interact with the hosts. They
        can ask questions, express their interest in purchasing, and even share their own product experiences with
        fellow viewers. When a viewer shows interest in a particular product, they can instantly make a purchase using
        dedicated links or designated purchasing methods.
      </p>

      <p>

        Live Commerce provides a uniquely interactive and entertaining shopping experience. Viewers gain immediate
        insights into product details, witness live demonstrations, and benefit from additional information provided by
        the hosts. This high level of engagement not only enhances consumer confidence in making purchase decisions but
        also introduces a dynamic and powerful approach to brand marketing.
      </p>

      <p>WebRTC can be used in this Scenario.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <section id="r1-uc-cb">
      <h2>Generic Packetization and Depacketization Mechanism for Audio Transmission</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#uc-cb">UC-CB</a>.</p>

      <p>
        When transmitting audio data, sending audio packets with a size greater than 1500 bytes per frame will result in
        transmission failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spatial audio codecs like <a href="#dfn-audio-vivid">Audio Vivid</a> have audio packets per frame that are
        larger than
        1500 bytes, requiring developers to handle packetization and depacketization separately. In order to improve
        development efficiency,
        a generic packetization and depacketization mechanism for audio transmission is needed.
      </p>

      <p>The mechanism should not be mandatory, for some proprietary audio codecs may have its own packetization and
        depacketization mechanisms.</p>

      <p>A proposed packetization and depacketization workflow can be outlined as follows: </p>

      <figure id="fig-uc-cb">
        <img alt="WebMedia" src="images/webrtc-packetization-depacketization.png" width="600">
        <figcaption><span>a proposed Packetization and Depacketization Workflow</span></figcaption>
      </figure>

    </section>


    <section id="r2-uc-cb">
      <h2>Receiving sounds from other devices when in background</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#uc-cb">UC-CB</a>.</p>

      <p>
        An iOS device that has the microphone enabled and then switches to the background is unable to hear sounds from
        other devices when some device unmutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This issue can be reproduced as follows:

      <ul>
        <li>Devices A and B join a WebRTC conference, B is an iOS device, A is any device</li>
        <li>Both devices activate microphones</li>
        <li>Device B goes to the background (e.g., Home button).</li>
        <li>Device A's voice is audible to B.</li>
        <li>Device A mutes its microphone.</li>
        <li>Device A unmutes and speaks.</li>
        <li>Device B can't hear A, even if B goes back to the foreground.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Statistics for Audio and Video Stuttering and Initial Frame Time</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#uc-cb">UC-CB</a> and <a href="#UC-RLC">UC-RLC</a>.</p>

      <p>Currently, WebRTC has encompassed Quality of Service (QoS) metrics including resolution, frame rate, bit rate, and packet loss, and interfaces have been exposed for developers to access various metrics. However,  metrics related to audio and video stuttering, as well as initial frame time, have not yet been provided for statistical analysis and reporting. In WebRTC applications such as interactive live streaming and video conferencing, metrics concerning audio and video stuttering, along with initial frame time, are considered crucial QoS indicators. They offer enhanced insights into the quality of audio and video communication.</p>
      <p>
        The definition of <b>stuttering</b> needs to be officially defined, and developers can customize the duration of the interval that qualifies as a single instance of stuttering.
