    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <section>
      <h2 id="uc-cb">5G Cloud Box (UC-CB)</h2>

      <p>
        A "Cloud Box" can be understood as a cloud-based private room, similar to the private room we have in our real
        lives. Friends can come together in these rooms to chat, watch movies, and watching sports events. In sports
        broadcasts, fans can participate in predictions and discussions about ongoing matches through the "5G Cloud Box"
        feature, enabling them to share their insights and forecasts in real-time. The Cloud Box feature bridges the gap
        between individuals, enhancing their immersive experience and interaction.
      </p>

      <p>In order to provide a more immersive user experience, spatial audio is utilized in WebRTC when watching Ultra HD sports events.

    <section>
      <h2 id="UC-RLC">Real-time Live Commerce (UC-RLC)</h2>
      <p>

        Real-time Live Commerce, also known as real-time livestream shopping, is an innovative retail trend that merges
        real-time streaming
        with e-commerce. In Live Commerce sessions, businesses and brands showcase their products or services on live
        online platforms, such as social media and e-commerce websites, while simultaneously engaging with the audience
        in direct interactions. During these live sessions, hosts or salespeople introduce product features, demonstrate
        usage, address viewer inquiries, and offer exclusive deals or limited-time promotions.

      </p>

      <p>

        Viewers can actively participate by using real-time commenting or chat features to interact with the hosts. They
        can ask questions, express their interest in purchasing, and even share their own product experiences with
        fellow viewers. When a viewer shows interest in a particular product, they can instantly make a purchase using
        dedicated links or designated purchasing methods.
      </p>

      <p>

        Live Commerce provides a uniquely interactive and entertaining shopping experience. Viewers gain immediate
        insights into product details, witness live demonstrations, and benefit from additional information provided by
        the hosts. This high level of engagement not only enhances consumer confidence in making purchase decisions but
        also introduces a dynamic and powerful approach to brand marketing.
      </p>

      <p>WebRTC can be used in this Scenario.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <section id="r1-uc-cb">
      <h2>Generic Packetization and Depacketization Mechanism for Audio Transmission</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#uc-cb">UC-CB</a>.</p>

      <p>
        When transmitting audio data, sending audio packets with a size greater than 1500 bytes per frame will result in
        transmission failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spatial audio codecs like <a href="#dfn-audio-vivid">Audio Vivid</a> have audio packets per frame that are
        larger than
        1500 bytes, requiring developers to handle packetization and depacketization separately. In order to improve
        development efficiency,
        a generic packetization and depacketization mechanism for audio transmission is needed.
      </p>

      <p>The mechanism should not be mandatory, for some proprietary audio codecs may have its own packetization and
        depacketization mechanisms.</p>

      <p>A proposed packetization and depacketization workflow can be outlined as follows: </p>

      <figure id="fig-uc-cb">
        <img alt="WebMedia" src="images/webrtc-packetization-depacketization.png" width="600">

      </figure>

    </section>


    <section id="r2-uc-cb">
      <h2>Receiving sounds from other devices when in background</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#uc-cb">UC-CB</a>.</p>

      <p>
        An iOS device that has the microphone enabled and then switches to the background is unable to hear sounds from
        other devices when some device unmutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This issue can be reproduced as follows:

      <ul>
        <li>Devices A and B join a WebRTC conference, B is an iOS device, A is any device</li>
        <li>Both devices activate microphones</li>
        <li>Device B goes to the background (e.g., Home button).</li>
        <li>Device A's voice is audible to B.</li>
        <li>Device A mutes its microphone.</li>
        <li>Device A unmutes and speaks.</li>
        <li>Device B can't hear A, even if B goes back to the foreground.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

    </section>


    <section id="r3-uc-statistics">
      <h2>Statistics for Audio and Video Stuttering and Initial Frame Time</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#uc-cb">UC-CB</a>, <a href="#uc-mcc">UC-MCC</a>,  and <a href="#UC-RLC">UC-RLC</a>.</p>

      <p>Currently, WebRTC has encompassed Quality of Service (QoS) metrics including resolution, frame rate, bit rate, and packet loss, and interfaces have been exposed for developers to access various metrics. However,  metrics related to audio and video stuttering, as well as initial frame time, have not yet been provided for statistical analysis and reporting. In WebRTC applications such as interactive live streaming and video conferencing, metrics concerning audio and video stuttering, along with initial frame time, are considered crucial QoS indicators. They offer enhanced insights into the quality of audio and video communication.</p>
      <p>
        The definition of <b>stuttering</b> needs to be officially defined, and developers can customize the duration of the interval that qualifies as a single instance of stuttering.
      </p>

    </section>
    
    
    <section id="r4-uc-gop">
      <h2>Fixed GOP encode interval</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#UC-RLC">UC-RLC</a>.</p>

      <p>In the live-streaming scene, the encoder needs to output video frames at a fixed GOP interval (such as GOP=2 seconds). We hope that an API can be provided to set GOP interval.</p>

    </section>

    
    <section id="r5-uc-rtcpxr">
      <h2>Enable RTCP-XR (RRTR/DLRR) at recv-only mode</h2>

      <p>This requirement is for <a href="#UC-RLC">UC-RLC</a>.</p>

      <p>In the live-streaming scene, the player endpoint is generally in recv-only mode. If the player endpoint wants to calculate RTT (round-trip time), one possible approach is to use <b>RTCP-XR</b> [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3611">RFC3611</a>]. Currently, WebRTC already supports RTCP-XR, but the offer generated by browser doesn't contain it. We hope the browser adds an API to enable the RTCP-XR.</p>
